# Library Management System

The goal of the Library Management System (LMS) is to provide a digital platform that makes it easier to manage a library's resources, such as its books, borrowers, due dates, and inventory, efficiently and in an orderly way. By automating and optimizing key library procedures, the system seeks to enhance the entire library experience for employees as well as users.

| IDE                     | [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)                                | IntelliJ is a wonderful IDE to use for a Java project since everyone on the team has used it.                                                                                                                                                |
| Dependency Management   | [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)                             | The project object model file (POM.xml) is something we are familiar with, and Maven is a popular build automation and project management tool. It supports the management of project lifecycles, build processes, and project dependencies. |
| Project Scope           | Library Management System                                               | The scope of a Library Management System (LMS) project includes the development and implementation of core features such as book and borrower management, user interfaces, data storage.                                                     |
| Communication Mechanism | Microsoft Teams and Emails                                              | We decided to use these platforms for communication because everyone is active on teams and everyone keeps constantly.                                                                                                                       |
| Branches merging        | Make a PR, get the other team members to approve it, and then merge it. | Everyone would be aware of the modifications each of us has made. In this way conflicts can also be avoided.                                                                                                                                 |

<br>

We as a team have resolved to speak out, communicate, and respectfully answer each other's concerns since we believe that most team problems are the result of misunderstandings or partial comprehension.

<br>

## Purpose

Creating a user friendly Library Management System, which would handle adding, updating and removing books from a library which would be done by library admin, and also allows user to borrow books and write review.

## Conflict Resolution

We usually think team issues are mostly due to partial understanding or misunderstanding so, we as a team have decided to speak up, communicate and clarify each other's questions in a timely and a respectful manner.

## Communication Mechanism

Microsoft Teams and Emails - We decided to use these platforms for communication because everyone is active on teams and everyone keeps constantly checking their emails.
